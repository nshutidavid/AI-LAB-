üß† Prerequisites

To ensure a successful learning experience, participants should have:

Intermediate-level Python programming skills.

Familiarity with basic data structures like lists and dictionaries.

Understanding of machine learning concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, overfitting, regularization, and the use of training, validation, and test sets.

A passing score (66% or higher) on the admissions quiz.

üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Learn

Throughout the program, you'll engage in six end-to-end computer vision projects, each designed to build upon the previous one. These projects encompass:

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Prepare and preprocess visual data for model training.

Model Training: Develop and train custom computer vision models using deep learning frameworks.

Advanced Techniques: Apply methods like transfer learning to enhance model performance.

Deployment: Implement models to solve real-world problems in various domains.

üìÇ Projects Overview

The following projects are part of the curriculum:

Wildlife Conservation in C√¥te d'Ivoire: Classify animals in camera trap images to aid in wildlife preservation efforts.

Crop Disease Detection in Uganda: Identify and classify crop diseases to support agricultural health.

Traffic Flow Analysis in Bangladesh: Analyze traffic patterns to improve urban planning and safety.

Medical Imaging in Spain: Detect anomalies in medical images to assist in healthcare diagnostics.

Facial Recognition in India: Develop models for identifying and verifying individuals based on facial features.

Generative AI Techniques: Explore and implement generative models in computer vision applications.

Each project is accompanied by a series of lessons and assignments to reinforce learning and ensure mastery of the concepts.
