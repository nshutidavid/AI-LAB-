Uganda Crop Disease Classification â€“ Applied AI Lab Project
ðŸŒ± Project Overview

This project is part of the Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision by WorldQuant University.

The focus of this project is on classifying crop disease images from Uganda. The dataset consists of images representing five different crop disease categories. The goal is to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify these images and apply advanced techniques to improve model performance.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Explore and preprocess a crop disease image dataset.

Build and train a CNN for multiclass image classification.

Enhance model performance using Transfer Learning with pre-trained models.

Detect and address model overfitting.

Evaluate performance with k-fold cross-validation.

Optimize training using Callbacks such as Learning Rate Scheduling, Model Checkpointing, and Early Stopping.
