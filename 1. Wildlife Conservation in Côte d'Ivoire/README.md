Wildlife Conservation in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire â€“ Applied AI Lab Project
ðŸŒ¿ Project Overview

This project is part of the Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision by WorldQuant University.

In this project, the focus is on a data science competition aimed at helping scientists track wildlife in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire. Camera traps capture thousands of images, and the goal is to classify which animal, if any, appears in each image.

By completing this project, you will strengthen your practical skills in computer vision and machine learning while contributing to wildlife conservation efforts.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Build and train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for multiclass image classification.

Prepare and preprocess raw image data for model training.

Make accurate predictions on unseen images.

Generate a competition-ready submission from your predictions.

ðŸ§  Skills & Concepts Learned

During this project, you will learn to:

Read and process image files for machine learning tasks.

Use PyTorch for tensor manipulation and neural network development.

Build a CNN optimized for image classification.

Evaluate model performance and make predictions on new data.

Prepare predictions in the correct format for submission to a competition.
